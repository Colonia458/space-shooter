# Space Shooter Game

### Intro

This is a simple and straightfoward game I made as a beginner project in Godot. 

The aim of the game is to avoid the meteors for as long as possible, while shooting them also.

I followed this youtube playlist link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7wlSvt0JIc&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iHCXBpxbdsOByZ55Ez4bgF
